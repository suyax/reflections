How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
it breaks the code into different sections
and then find out the sections that are different
so i easily compare the code on the same line


what do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

it makes every commit make more sense, became more logical.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

doc only affect one doc.  git commit helps track all the files and functions needed to tun a big commend or the program.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

open git log and find commit for the comments that you are looking for compare the that version of commit with the previous version use diff 

how mint using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
 we can put it back by going back to old version of it

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
