When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when more than one person working on the same project. or you want comments from other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
some files you do not want to incorporate to your version? too much up load and download when you are working.
